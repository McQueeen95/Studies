## NumPy to create 2-D arrays
# [1] NumPy(Numerical Python) is an open-source package that is widely used in science and engineering
# [2] After this assignment you will be able to:
#       Use Jupyter Notebook and its features.
#       Use NumPy functions to create arrays and NumPy array operations.
#       Use indexing and slicing for 2-D arrays.
#       Find the shape of an array, reshape it and stack it horizontally and vertically.
# [3] Jupyter Notebooks are interactive coding journals that integrate live code, explanatory text, equations, visualizations and other multimedia resources, all in a single document
